Project purpose:

For testing applications, Robot Framework may be used to provide a way of automating test runs, reducing the reliance of manual testing, and ensuring that local changes in the code base do not have detrimental effect on existing behaviour elsewhere.

This project was created to allow Robot Framework based testing to drive an Arduino board, and automate physical actions without overly expensive hardware.
